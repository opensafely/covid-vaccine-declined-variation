# OpenSAFELY - COVID Vaccines Declined

This is designed as a rapid analysis of codes for vaccines being declined and how their usage varies by practice and age group. It may include patients who had declined but were later vaccinated. 

# About the OpenSAFELY framework

The OpenSAFELY framework is a secure analytics platform for
electronic health records research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and
transporting them elsewhere for analysis, the framework supports
developing analytics against dummy data, and then running against the
real data *within the same infrastructure that the data is stored*.
